# Notes, stage D3 (adjudication by element)

The model entered D3 frozen at pass 15 (e15f96470271763d9913e79ed8e332c164a1f176106eefacfe8ffac8e1b3fecd). A revision made here changes the model's hash; the model is frozen again, as one version, at D3c.

## What binds the rulings

- **J, 16 October, 12:59 Berlin** (through the PI):
  - Every count and reading of absent lines is split by `observation`. Only `observed-absent` and `not-needed` count as evidenced specification. `unobserved` and `not-testable` are limits of the evidence, counted apart and never as specification or correction.
  - `DROPS/D/REPAIRS.tsv` gives each room's same-session repairs: 378 rooms, 421 repairs. Where repairs bear on a ruling, repaired and unrepaired rooms are compared.
  - The labeler grade's lack of variation and the `RETURN-D2v` field defects are recorded for E2.
- **QD2-001 (J):** a dimension may stand as the element of restrict, add-condition and add-step. The eight such lines are ruled as they stand.
- **QD3-001 (J: yes to both):** each packet is read whole through `_analysis/d3_packet.py`, which selects what `mem.py adaptations --element` selects and prints every field. Rulings may be written per packet through `_analysis/d3_adjudicate_batch.py` from a rulings file (`_analysis/d3_rulings/`). The file gives a decision and a reason for every id, with no default; the writer makes the verb's checks and refuses the whole file on any failure.

## The ruling rules (logged before any line was ruled)

- **G1, instantiate.** Accept as specification when the source theme and the cited concepts show the element as stated, inside its range. Modify when the `how` claims more than the concepts show. Reject when the concepts show something else, and say what.
  - **G1a:** a member's own claim in the record to have started, made or first placed the mark shows R01's act. So do other members naming that member as its maker. A claim made after the work is weaker, and the reason says so.
  - **G1b:** each line is ruled on the line as read, with its concepts read where the `how` is doubtful. In each packet, ten lines drawn by `random.Random(20261016 + the packet's offset)` have their concepts read in full (`_analysis/d3_sample_packet.py`). A draw that finds an unsupported line sends the whole packet to be read whole.
- **G2, absent lines that mark an evidence limit** (`unobserved`, `not-testable`). Accept with kind `none` when the line gives a reason the record cannot show the element. The stage check admits no kind named "evidence limit", so kind `none` is how these lines are counted apart.
  - Where the room's placements carry the element, the concepts are read first.
  - Reject the line when the concepts show the element.
- **G3, evidenced absences** (`observed-absent`, `not-needed`). Accept as specification when the concepts show the absence or the lack of need. Otherwise reclassify as an evidence limit.
- **G4 and G5, elaborations and corrections.** Accept with `pair` when a second room's line makes the same elaboration or correction of the same element in substance, whatever its node. Otherwise the line is a particular if its evidence suffices, and pending if not.
  - Two accepted corrections that meet at the same third- or fourth-order node trigger the element's re-examination in the same leg (§2).
  - The count never chooses the revision.
- **G6.** A line that fails portability, or names its own room in `condition`, is a particular.
- **G7.** Repaired and unrepaired rooms are compared wherever repairs could bear on a ruling.
- **G8.** Every reason names its evidence.

## Where the mass is (`_views/rooms-x-elements.tsv`, `_analysis/d3_mass.py`)

| Lines | Count |
|---|---|
| All lines | 42,243 |
| Other than absent | 26,206 |
| Absent, evidence limits | 14,608 |
| Absent, evidenced | 67 |
| `propose` | 1,362 |

The heaviest elements by lines other than absent are P02 1,039, P05 1,004, P01 1,003, P04 980, P12 926 and K01 913. The arrows together hold 6,778 such lines, and lines naming a dimension hold 122. Each leg takes one element group: a fourth-order theme's elements, or one element with many lines.

## D3a-01: R01, the starter

R01's lines number 709, across 699 rooms. All are ruled, and none is pending.

| op | lines | accept | as evidence limit (kind none) | reject | particular | modify |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| instantiate | 579 | 566 | 0 | 5 | 7 | 1 |
| absent (all evidence limits) | 107 | 0 | 82 | 25 | 0 | 0 |
| restrict | 17 | 12 (correction) | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| add-condition | 3 | 1 (elaboration) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| add-step | 3 | 2 (elaboration) | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

**The correction, met twice, and move 172.**
- **The lines:** eleven rooms' restrict lines (Madeon-005, batman-016, futanari-009, androidgaming-013, hearthstone-008, hentai-003, katawashoujo-029, shitredditsays-004, tetris-005, transgender-005, vietnam-008) correct one clause of R01: *and whom others then join*. Six of them meet at T4-006, four of those at T3-033, and three meet at T4-005 (T3-002).
- **What the concepts show:** in every one, the starter's own act (asking, proposing, mapping, beginning, or placing alone), and no one shown joining that member.
- **Why the clause went:** R01's own range already ran from a member who only asks to a member who places alone. The statement therefore claimed more than its range. Where the records show anyone joining, they show it as an answer to a call, which the model already holds in P15, A02 and A01.
- **The revision:** the clause was split from the role (Grodal, Anteby and Holm's *splitting*) and left to those arrows. The statement now reads: *The starter: a member who proposes the mark, maps it or begins placing it. Others joining is not part of the role: it is the answer to the room's call (P15), in the order A02 and A01 state.*
- **No loosening:** the range is unchanged, so no room enters or leaves the role.
- **The record:** a `history.jsonl` line, a diary move and the snap `D3-move-splitting-172`. F-017 touches R01; it was re-examined in the same act and stands unchanged (`findings.jsonl` line 37).

**Accepted beside the revision, paired, and not folded into the statement:**
- the starter's acts shared among a few members (yugioh-009 with polandball-018);
- the start handed from one member to another (hunterxhunter-009 with shield-058).

Two rooms each are a thin warrant. They stand as shared elaborations for D4 to read, not as a change to the role.

**Particulars** (held in their rooms):
- two starts on canvases opened after hour 73 (AcePlace-029, TransFlagPlace-003);
- the starter of an enlargement as distinct from the first start (thailand-008);
- deference to a starter that gave no lasting command (metroid-012);
- a room taking up a sign begun outside it (loliconsunite-006);
- five lines that fail portability.

**Absent lines rejected (25).**
- **The pattern:** the labeler marked R01 unobserved only because no one was shown joining, while the cited concept shows a member proposing, mapping or beginning the mark. That is R01 as revised, and it was already inside the old range.
- **Three re-ruled under G1a:** thebluecorner-003, teamcube-023 and apocalypserising-029, each from evidence limit to reject.
- **Two absent lines left as evidence limits although the room's placements carry R01:** glasgow-024 points to a saltire already in progress, and ElderScrolls-008 was rejected.

**Instantiate lines rejected or modified (6).**
- belgium-001 adds to a flag that already exists;
- sonicthehedgehog-029 carries on a face already half built;
- uvic-002 calls to defend a placed logo;
- wholesomememes-002 asks others to help hearts that already exist;
- zootopia-002 cites only an instruction to place;
- TeamDignitas-001 is modified: the starter is reported, not named.

**Repairs (G7).** R01's rulings do not differ between lines in repaired rooms (381 lines) and unrepaired rooms (328 lines): reject 3.9% against 4.6%, evidence limits 11.5% against 13.1%, particular 1.8% against 0.9%.

**Disclosed limits.**
- Before QD3-001 was answered, packets were read through the verb, which clips each `how` at 90 characters.
- The first 25 instantiate reasons were worded as if every concept had been read; for most, only the line and its placement were read.
- After the answer, every ruled R01 line was re-read whole. One ruling changed (belgium-001).
- Every packet's seeded draw was read in full. One draw found an unsupported line (sonicthehedgehog-029), and that packet was read whole.

**The re-check.** R01 is a rewritten element, so the rooms whose adapted accounts rely on it go to the re-check (§5). The scope, `recheck-scope.json`, is set when the re-check is built, after the element groups.

### Close-check, D3a-01

`validate.py D3` reports 709 of 42,243 ledger lines ruled, and nothing wrong with the rulings. It fails on one shape alone, in five lines: P06, R02, K03, K04 and P19 carry status `candidate` from the C2 and C5 cuts, but the D3 check admits a candidate only with `since: D3`, a proposal accepted at this stage. Changing a status before these elements' own groups are ruled would pre-empt those rulings, and setting `since` to D3 would misstate their history. I asked as QD3-002 and changed neither.

**J's answer (QD3-002).** J said the question forgot that the analyst is doing induction. I may place these codes where I see fit, with some documentation, deciding from the knowledge of the population I have amassed. Rules are useful, but I should ask for the changes I need so that the knowledge shows; the rules should not bound the understanding. The handler changed the check to admit a candidate cut at an earlier stage, and `validate.py D3` now gives 0 errors.

**My reading of the five.** They keep status `candidate` for now. No rule binds them. The evidence that would decide them is their own D2 lines (lines other than absent: P06 in 564 rooms, K04 in 530, R02 in 500, P19 in 240, K03 in 124), and I have not read those yet. Each is re-admitted, bounded, withdrawn or kept when its group is read.
